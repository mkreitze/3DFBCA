# 3DFBCA
This records my work generating 3D FBCA (Fashion Based Cellular Automata, first explored in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7317958).

The file 2state3DFBCA.py generates wavefront (.obj) files for every update of an FBCA with user defined length, width, height, score matrix (S), number of updates (g) and random seed (L_0). This is the most basic version only allowing for two states. The user defined variables can be inputted on lines 9-17 utilizing any text editor. Personally I run this file on the most recent version of Ubuntu using python3. 

Additionally, this repository includes a python file that generates a stack of cubes depending on user parameters as a wavefront (.obj) file.
